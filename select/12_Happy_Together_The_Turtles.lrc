[00:08.00] Imagine me and you, I do
[00:11.32] I think about you day and night
[00:13.89] It's only right
[00:15.46] To think about the girl you love
[00:17.72] And hold her tight
[00:19.53] So happy together
[00:28.03] 
[00:23.85] If I should call you up, invest a dime
[00:27.20] And you say you belong to me
[00:29.71] And ease my mind
[00:31.44] Imagine how the world could be
[00:33.60] So very fine
[00:35.44] So happy together
[00:43.94] 
[00:40.22] I can't see me lovin' nobody but you for all my life
[00:48.37] When you're with me, baby, the skies will be blue for all my life
[01:20.87] 
[00:56.31] Me and you, and you and me
[00:58.93] No matter how they tossed the dice
[01:01.72] It had to be
[01:03.13] The only one for me is you
[01:05.41] And you for me
[01:07.05] So happy together
[01:15.55] 
[01:12.08] I can't see me lovin' nobody but you for all my life
[01:19.70] When you're with me, baby, the skies will be blue for all my life
[01:52.20] 
[01:28.18] Me and you, and you and me
[01:30.98] No matter how they tossed the dice
[01:33.45] It had to be
[01:35.04] The only one for me is you
[01:37.69] And you for me
[01:39.34] So happy together
[01:47.84] 
[02:01.71] Me and you, and you and me
[02:05.39] No matter how they tossed the dice
[02:07.75] It had to be
[02:09.42] The only one for me is you
[02:11.52] And you for me
[02:13.64] So happy together
[02:17.38] So happy together
[02:21.34] And how is the weather?
[02:32.84] 
[02:25.38] So happy together
[02:29.34] We're happy together
[02:33.34] So happy together
[02:37.40] We're happy together
[02:41.40] So happy together
[02:45.35] So happy together
