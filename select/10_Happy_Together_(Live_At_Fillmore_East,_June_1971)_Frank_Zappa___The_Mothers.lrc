[00:00.98] Say!
[00:05.07] Imagine me and you,
[00:06.52] I do,
[00:07.72] I think about you day and night
[00:10.17] It's only right,
[00:11.86] To think about the girl you love
[00:13.94] And hold her tight,
[00:15.36] So happy together
[00:19.61] If i should call you up,
[00:21.46] Invest a dime
[00:22.78] And you say you belong to me,
[00:25.16] And ease my mind
[00:26.55] Imagine how the world would be,
[00:28.53] So very fine,
[00:29.84] So happy together
[00:32.00] (Just like a big rock-show)
[00:34.78] I can't see me lovin' nobody but you for all
[00:39.05] My life
[00:41.99] When you're with me, baby,
[00:44.43] The skies will be blue for all my life
[00:47.88] (Everybody sing along like a big rock-show,
[00:50.61] Come on!)

[01:55.22] Graham is closin'
[01:56.14] Down the fillmore, but ah, i'm sure he'll
[02:00.50] Get into somethin' better
